Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, artifacts,experiments, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dcv pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7> Now git add, commit, push


Setting up dcv pipeline (with params)
8> add params.yaml file
9> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10> Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with the params
11> Now git add, commit, push

Expermients with DVC:
12> pip install dvclive
13> Add the dvclive code block (mentioned below)
14> Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an experiment by DVC)
15> Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extension on VSCode (install dvc extension)
16> Do "dvc exp remove {exp-name}" to remove exp (optional) | "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp
17> Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
18> Now git add, commit, push

Branch Based Experiment Workflow (Multi-Model Setup):
19> Choose and fix a baseline model run (best accuracy or best recall) and commit it on main branch.
20> Create a new branch for experiments:
    "git checkout -b experiment/multi-model"
21> Update params.yaml to support model selection using:
    model_building.model_name: rf / logreg / nb
22> Restructure params.yaml to treat all models equally using:
    models.rf, models.logreg, models.nb blocks
23> Update src/model_building.py to train the selected model based on model_name:
    RandomForest / LogisticRegression / MultinomialNB
24> Update dvc.yaml model_building stage params tracking keys:
    Replace old keys (model_building.n_estimators, etc.)
    With new keys (models.rf.*, models.logreg.*, models.nb.*, model_building.model_name)
25> Run experiments one by one:
    "dvc exp run -S model_building.model_name=rf"
    "dvc exp run -S model_building.model_name=logreg"
    "dvc exp run -S model_building.model_name=nb"
26> Compare experiments results:
    "dvc exp show"
    or check using VS Code DVC extension Experiments tab
27> Identify best model based on metrics (accuracy/precision/recall/auc) and finalize the best config.
28> Now git add, commit, push from experiment branch.
